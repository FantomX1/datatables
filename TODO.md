2) config object passable pure, and setters method on it, passable for others,
not for that object decisions inside - passable, not an attribute - done


4) passing identifier only for form, not get values, still not at the same time, or in own
window = prefix


5) common hidden always, not different variables and processing for values and keys that
what contains keys that handles, all send same and handled by keys - regards filtering
RequestHandler::get('sdasda'); 3) whether to differentiate if filter also by non -id values from text columns
                               getting unique values, probably not, not yet

6) make javascript, but get some data prior for testing

7) provides from other framework classes but also closures from calling from within a single file
plugins
 statically plugin configuration at single place during lifetime of script
 can be added also closure if more handlers at single class but how interface
 extendable by own plugins - done, but closures


8)
global config to set param ini set not only method, however if passed object into it or classname
- done

9) signal handlers -done

10) error class and input adapters - done

11) a emit default  warning not passed query executer

                                    // or just a simple callable closure for that case

14) make command to ask interativelly for a webDir document root path

15) consider web directories being always above vendor dir, not to supply path in a relative format, perhaps just except of a few
special scenarios like assets/document-root being in completely different folders than the project itself, check for the absolute path too


16)  @TODO: dont' order all/implicitly when empty

17) selected from prefilled values

18) a filter get & order after order in session?

19) filter only for some

20) default sort by

21) custom columns post-processing

22) adjust/parametrize getQueryForList mechanism for soft-deleted and other way restricted items
+setRunChecked calling run and column with checks for queryExecutor being initialised

23) in directory examples to see straight from the shelf it's usage and appearance in practice
